        It’s not unusual for students in the hard sciences to spend a lot of
        time in the lab, but Chemical Engineering major
        <strong> Taylor Little</strong> gets to work out “in the field” in ways
        many undergraduate students in her field don’t—as part of a
        community-based social justice research project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taylor, who is also an <strong> MLK scholar</strong>, worked with Dr.
        Daniela Terson de Paleville on the Minds In Motion project, which
        assesses how a physical fitness program during school hours may affect
        academic, physical, and social development in students at Hawthorne
        Elementary. Taylor assisted with pre- and post- testing with the
        students, recording/analyzing data, presenting the research at academic
        conferences, and expanding the project to an Indianapolis middle school,
        among other projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s not exactly the same kind of work as her major, but Taylor values
        the opportunity to work with more people and on a social justice
        issue—access to quality physical education—that matters to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s nice to have more interactive research than just sitting in the
        lab and staring at stuff,” she observed. “I also think it made me more
        aware of issues with technology and how kids’ childhoods are changing […
        and] the value of more traditional play.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Taylor noted that working on this project has helped her develop more
        diverse academic and professional skills, such as presentation skills
        and thinking about how academic research can benefit the community.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="js-spotlight-right-body" class="text-left content-text fnt-goth-book">
      <p>
        “A huge part of engineering is thinking about how it affects other
        people, economics, and broader stuff like that,” she said. In the Minds
        and Motion project, researchers were concerned with “more than the main
        point of the project itself. How can it be replicated? How is it going
        to affect other populations?”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> The Minds in Motion project</strong> is just one of the ways
        Taylor stays active in social justice concerns. As the former
        environmental ownership chair and current global impact chair of her
        sorority (Alpha Kappa Alpha), she has led projects such as an event
        turning t-shirts into resusable grocery bags, a vegan dinner to talk
        about sustainable food consumption, and a Soles for Souls campaign
        turning old shoes into water that can be transported to water-deprived
        communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taylor will soon begin a co-op with LG&E, working in plant operations
        and gas storage, but noted that as she continues developing herself for
        a career in chemical engineering, she will carry her experiences on the
        Minds in Motion Project with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It reassured me that I like doing research outside of my own major and
        outside of a lab,” Taylor said.

    <div id="js-spotlight-left-body" class="text-left">
      <p>
        Ann Hagan-Grigsby’s path to Park DuValle Community Health Center was an
        unexpected one. Growing up as a black female in Washington D. C.,
        Hagan-Grisby worked hard from a young age, earning a spot as a National
        Merit Semi-Finalist in high school. She studied hard but did not think
        she would be able to go to college. Instead, she decided to follow in
        her mother’s footsteps and go into the real estate business that her
        mother had successfully started. However, one of Hagan-Grigsby’s high
        school teachers and counselors saw so much potential in her that she
        helped her secure a full-ride scholarship to George Washington
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Hagan-Grigsby was still faced with doubt from those around her.
        White students made it clear that black students were not welcome at GW,
        and professors had little faith that she could become a doctor, instead
        telling her that she should study something easier because “medicine is
        not for people like you.” Even still, Hagan-Grigsby ended up at the
        University of Louisville, with a full ride to medical school.
        Hagan-Grigsby ultimately decided to choose a different path, which led
        her to Park DuValle Community Health Center.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1992, Hagan-Grigsby was working as a Medical Research Technician for
        the University of Louisville Kidney Disease Program. Someone remembered
        her from her time at the University of Louisville’s School of Medicine
        and invited her to apply for a position at the West Louisville Area
        Health Education Center, which required Hagan-Grigsby to work at Park
        DuValle. Park DuValle immediately felt like home to Hagan-Grigsby, who
        loved the ethnically diverse, family-like work environment located in
        West Louisville.
      </p>

      About seven months after she began her new job at Park DuValle, tragedy
      struck. Hagan-Grigsby’s house in the Portland neighborhood was firebombed,
      along with three others in her neighborhood. Thankfully, Hagan-Grigsby and
      her children made it out of the house unharmed, and it was through this
      tragedy that Hagan-Grigsby found support at Park DuValle. The staff—some
      of
    </div>
    <div id="js-spotlight-right-body" class="text-left content-text fnt-goth-book">
      <p>
        whom Hagan-Grigsby barely knew—came together to help her and her family
        by collecting household items, clothing, and money. Hagan-Grigsby was
        touched by the staff who rallied around her as if they had known her for
        her whole life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, Hagan-Grigsby has become the CEO of Park DuValle, and she
        continues to provide support to the West Louisville community. In recent
        years, Park DuValle and Hagan-Grigsby have partnered with the Consortium
        to document how West Louisville residents experience well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hagan-Grigsby says that the research she has done with the Consortium is
        unique in that typically researchers come in with preconceived and
        oftentimes inaccurate assumptions about the people who live in West
        Louisville. Conversely, Dr. Meera Alagaraja and her team have focused on
        the aspects of well-being and the joy that the patients experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with the Consortium, Hagan-Grigsby has been able to truly
        collaborate with the researchers in an environment where the input of
        the staff and patients was highly valued. The purpose of the project
        “Elucidating the Stories of Wellbeing in the West Louisville Community:
        A Phenomenological Study” is to aid the clinic in the assessment of
        wellbeing and coping strategies for its patients.

        When Dion Copeland started as a freshman at UofL, he noticed something
        was off.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just coming to campus, I was exposed to a lot of systematic
        oppression,” he said. For example, he noticed there weren’t a lot of
        people of color in key leadership positions in the university. “I’m just
        interested in seeing what keeps people from pursuing these roles. I want
        a greater understanding of why that happens, not only on campus, but
        around the United States.”
      </p>

      <p>
        These and other racial justice-related interests keep Copeland—a
        sophomore from Lexington—busy filling many leadership roles while
        pursuing a secondary education degree at UofL. They have also drawn him
        to becoming one of the Consortium’s first undergraduate research
        fellows, a role in which he has worked on research related to HIV stigma
        and housing justice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Being able to sit on research teams that contribute to the advancement
        of marginalized people appealed to me,” he said. “It will give me that
        experience of learning how to find ground-breaking tools and methods to
        change things we don’t like.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to sitting on various university committees, a few of
        Copeland’s leadership positions include: Campus Ambassador, Freshman
        Orientation lead, Black Student Union president, College of Education
        and Human Development student president, Police Advisory Board member,
        and Chair of the African American Programming Fund, which provides
        funding for multicultural Resident Student Organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leadership roles consume all his free time, and Copeland has his sights
        set on a different leadership role: school principal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="js-spotlight-right-body" class="text-left content-text fnt-goth-book">
      <p>
        By becoming a school principal, Copeland hopes to combat the
        school-to-prison pipeline (and other ways school systems fail children
        of color).
      </p>

      <p>
        “I want to show kids that education is key. If they’re starting out just
        not being able to find that connection to school, they may never find
        it,” Copeland said. “I’d like to go into administration and connect
        people and foster those relationships.”

        Brandeis Law student Samantha Wright is a single mom whose interests in
        law and community activism are driven by her children. As the
        Consortium’s law student fellow, Wright has pursued these interests as a
        research assistant with Kentucky Youth Advocates.
      </p>

      <p>
        “As a mom, every decision I make includes my kids. It’s hard when you
        are researching school shootings, School Resource Officers, and lunch
        shaming practices to not feel emotionally compelled to do deliver
        research in line with my concerns and opinions as a mom,” Wright said.
        “KYA allowed me to research matters that I was unaware of as both a
        student and a mom.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year, Wright spoke with a friend who worked for the Consortium and
        knew that she wanted to become involved. Almost immediately after her
        receipt of the Consortium’s one-year law fellowship, the Consortium
        staff connected her to Kentucky Youth Advocates (KYA). KYA had expressed
        a need for legal research support, and Wright’s background and interests
        were a perfect fit.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="js-spotlight-right-body" class="text-left content-text fnt-goth-book">
      <p>
        During the 2017-2018 academic year, Wright’s work with the KYA has
        involved various research matters including kinship and the D.O. v.
        Glisson case, Kentucky’s foster care program, new hearsay exceptions,
        and protections for victims under Marsy’s Law. She has also examined the
        visitation experiences of children of incarcerated parents and the
        experiences of LGBTQI juveniles in detention centers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for her next steps, Wright said that she will work to identify other
        community options for foster kids who have aged-out of care. She will
        also be working on a diversity committee at Brandeis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wright indicated that her time with KYA has helped her grow
        professionally and stay committed to her personal values.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doing this type of work allows for my professional and personal life to
        intersect with one another,” Wright said. “As a mom and a student, I
        often have to engage in these roles separately, and they seldom cross
        into one another. However, this combination motivates me. I am able to
        be both an advocate and a mom, and the balance of the two became a lot
        easier because I could relate and I wanted to know what was being
        decided and how it would affect my boys. I have both advocacy and policy
        experience with law, and KYA allowed more experiences and research
        aligned with my personal needs and values.”

    <div id="js-spotlight-left-body" class="text-left">
      <p>
        Modern Languages professor Dr. Lluís Baixauli-Olmos had social justice
        research ideas boiling for months when, by chance, he met Dr. Katy
        Hopkins, a professor in Counseling and Human Development, at a
        neighborhood chili cook-off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Baixauli-Olmos was planning a graduate course on “Interpreting in Social
        Services and in Educational Settings,” seeking to infuse social justice
        aims into the course. When he heard about Dr. Hopkins’s work as Director
        of the Cardinal Success Program—which seeks to increase access to
        quality counseling and psychology services for residents from
        traditionally underserved neighborhoods in West Louisville—he thought,
        “This is it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, Baixauli-Olmos and Hopkins formed “The TIMIS Project:
        Trauma-Informed Mental Health Interpreting Services for Victims of
        Domestic Violence.” This project partners with the Cardinal Success
        Program and the Center for Women and Families to provide interpretation
        services in order for Spanish-speaking clients to be able to receive
        mental health care.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The core of this project is to counter structural inequalities by
        making it possible for women treated both in the Center for Women and
        Families and the Cardinal Success Program to receive language services,”
        he said. “In theory, this project would allow victims to recover some
        areas of their lives that maybe they have not been able to keep up with
        because of their traumatic experiences.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is in its early stages. Team members are meeting with
        partners, identifying language needs, and establishing a structure for
        the free interpreting services. In the future, Baixauli-Olmos hopes this
        project will guide other local offices that work with victims of trauma
        who may also be linguistic minorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing this work fills a necessary research gap—there’s not much
        scholarship on interpreting services for domestic violence survivors in
        mental health setting—and it also fills a personal motivation for
        Baixauli-Olmos—using his PhD to forward social justice aims.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What motivates me... is facilitating the provision of a necessary and
        crucial service to people who cannot receive basic services because of
        language barriers—services needed for those people to recover control,
        to go back to having a more healthy life,“ he said.

          about Palestinian displacement) to understand how refugees and others
          experience dislocation, dispossession, and urban renewal, in an effort
          to influence both public understanding and housing policy.

        As a Middle and Secondary Education major, Kaleb Clemons has observed a
        lot of students, but one that stands out to him is the one who always
        fell asleep—but not for the reasons you might imagine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kaleb recalls how day after day, the student fell asleep at his desk.
        His teacher would wake him up and try to engage him in classroom
        activities, but the student would fall right back asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than simply labeling this student as “bad,” or “lazy,” Kaleb and
        the teacher he was observing had a long conversation with the student,
        in which they discovered that he was working—often very late into the
        night—in order to support his whole family.
      </p>

      <p>
        This taught Kaleb an important lesson: “Teachers must get to know their
        students and learn about their lives so that we understand why students
        act the way they do. The student in the story was far from lazy, and he
        wasn’t even a bad kid; he just had priorities that at the moment are
        more important than paying attention in class.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Kaleb has continued to explore how to support students like this through
        participating in a Consortium-funded research project—“Transforming
        Learning Communities: A Multi-Year Project Supporting Teachers of
        Adolescents.” This project leverages student perspectives, consciousness
        building, and ongoing self-reflection and action to support long-term
        trauma-informed teacher education around classroom management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this project, Kaleb has learned classroom management strategies
        to help him more effectively support struggling students. Acknowledging
        trauma’s prevalence among K-12 classrooms, the project engages
        pre-service teachers in conversations about structural issues such as
        marginalization, racism, community violence, and experiences of people
        who are undocumented, as well as non-judgmental, trauma-sensitive
        teaching dispositions and practices.

      <p>
        Seeing the importance of trauma-informed teaching has also inspired
        Kaleb to consider a future in educational policy, through which he might
        be able to foster changes on a broader scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I believe our students deserve school policies that are based on
        ‘student-first’ ideas, and they desperately need teachers and
        administrators who are committed to being trauma-sensitive and
        progressive in the classroom,” Kaleb said. “I can only help a small
        number of students as a classroom teacher, but if I can change policies
        and law, I can reach many more students […] At this time, I do not know
        where I will land, but I do know that I am not aiming small.”

        <strong>What motivates you to do social justice work?</strong> “I am
        motivated by the people I am trying to help. I see the struggles people
        go through while still working very hard to make their life the best it
        can possibly be. Like the student who came to school each day with only
        a few hours of sleep, he could have easily stayed at home, but he
        didn’t. There are people that go to work and go to school everyday
        without having any food to eat. That is a reality I know nothing about.
        These people work hard, and I want to work just as hard to help them. I
        know I come from a privileged background; my parents have multiple
        degrees, I got new clothes every school year, and I got my tuition paid
        for here at UofL. I want to use the abilities I have and the privilege I
        have been afforded to help someone less fortunate. I want to share the
        education I am receiving here at UofL with people who may never have the
        opportunity to sit in a college classroom. I hope that through my work I
        can equal the playing field in some way.”

        The importance of social justice in academic research is nothing foreign to Dr. Lesley Harris of UofL’s Kent
        School of Social Work. Dr. Harris attributes her passion for social justice work to her experience of living in
        various communities across America,and learning to understand the root causes of the social problems that
        affect those communities, as well as their solutions. She notes that, even from the very beginning of her
        journey in higher education, the literature she encountered, as well as her practicum experience, allowed her
        to see the intrinsic relationship between social justice and the field of social work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Harris is the Primary Investigator on the Consortium-supported “Our World, Our Say” research project, a
        community based participatory action research project which utilizes the Photovoice methodology. Photovoice is
        a qualitative method that allows community participants to utilize photography to document and reflect their
        reality. This method is typically used to shed light on the unique perspective of a given community and on their
        perceived needs and strengths, and findings can often be used to advocate for social change. Dr. Marion Hambrick
        (CEHD) and Dr. Kyoungmee Byun (Fine Arts) work alongside Dr. Harris and their community partner –HIV and
        Health Care Support Center located in Vietnam— to bring this project to fruition. Together, with the help of
        youth in Hai Phong, the project hopes to raise awareness about the issues facing these young people through
        photography exhibits and other forms of advocacy. </p>

      <p>
        “Our World, Our Say” started this past summer in Hai Phong, Vietnam, where researchers worked with 25 young
        people who are being raised by their grandparents because their parents passed away due to
        HIV/AIDS-related illnesses. Using photography and other methods, the youth involved in this project identified
        HIV and reproductive health, child labor, child sexual abuse, and substance use as the most important issues
        to focus on in their community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trandisciplinarity of the “Our World, Our Say” team is one of its greatest strengths. When asked about the
        benefits of working on a transdisciplinary team, Dr. Harris expressed gratitude to her co-researchers and the
        expertise they each bring:
      </p>

      <p>
        “We wanted to be innovative in our methodology, [Dr. Hambrick] is an expert in social network
        analysis[...]. Very few Photovoice projects involve researchers who are artists, but to have an artist[Dr.
        Byun]has been invaluable, she’s given insight into how to exhibit the space to increase the message.” </p>

      <p>
        To aspiring social justice researchers and activists, Dr. Harris recommends the workbook Me and White
        Supremacy, by Layla Saad–but she notes that it is specifically aimed at well-meaning white people. The
        workbook provides guided self-work and self-reflection about how individuals may be upholding the systems of
        white supremacy. Dr. Harris promises, “This[book]has completely, and overwhelming changed my life!” </p>
